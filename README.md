# AWS Scalable Solution Architecture

This repository contains the **solution architecture design and documentation** for a scalable, fault-tolerant AWS infrastructure.  
It demonstrates how to combine **core AWS services** (EC2, RDS, Auto Scaling, ALB, CloudWatch, and SNS) into a reliable cloud-native environment that can handle growth, high availability, and monitoring with alerting.

## 📌 Project Deliverables
1. **Solution Architecture Diagram**
   - A visual representation of the proposed AWS solution.
   - Built using **Lucidchart**, but compatible with any diagramming tool.
   - Covers VPC, subnets, EC2 Auto Scaling, RDS Multi-AZ, Application Load Balancer, CloudWatch monitoring, and SNS notifications.

2. **GitHub Repository (this repo)**
   - Contains the **architecture diagram** and **README.md** documentation.
   - Provides a **clear explanation of how each AWS service works together**.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The architecture is designed around the following goals:
- **Scalability** → Handle variable workloads using Auto Scaling.
- **High Availability** → Multi-AZ deployment ensures resilience against failures.
- **Monitoring & Alerting** → CloudWatch + SNS ensures proactive detection and notification.
- **Security** → Private subnets for sensitive workloads; public subnets only for load balancers.

### Key AWS Components

- **Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)**
  - Provides an isolated network for the application.
  - Includes **public subnets** (for ALB, NAT gateways) and **private subnets** (for EC2 and RDS).

- **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**
  - Distributes traffic across EC2 instances in multiple AZs.
  - Ensures fault tolerance and even workload distribution.

- **Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling**
  - Launches or terminates EC2 instances based on traffic.
  - Uses scaling policies (CPU utilization, request count, etc.) for elasticity.

- **Amazon RDS (Multi-AZ)**
  - Relational Database Service with automatic failover.
  - Primary DB instance in one AZ, standby in another AZ.

- **Amazon CloudWatch**
  - Monitors metrics such as CPU utilization, disk space, and ALB errors.
  - Creates alarms when thresholds are breached.

- **Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service)**
  - Delivers alerts from CloudWatch alarms to subscribers.
  - Subscribers can be **Email**, **Slack Webhook**, or other AWS services.

- **NAT Gateways**
  - Allow private instances (EC2, RDS) to access the internet securely for updates without exposing them directly.

## 🔔 Workflow (Step-by-Step)

1. **User Access**
   - End users send requests to the **Application Load Balancer** (public-facing).

2. **Load Balancing**
   - The ALB routes traffic to EC2 instances in the **Auto Scaling Group** across multiple AZs.

3. **Application Layer**
   - EC2 instances process requests and, when needed, connect securely to **Amazon RDS** for database operations.

4. **Database Layer**
   - RDS operates in **Multi-AZ mode**: one primary DB and a standby DB in a different AZ for automatic failover.

5. **Monitoring & Alerts**
   - **CloudWatch** collects performance metrics and system logs.
   - **Alarms** are configured (e.g., EC2 CPU > 80%, ALB 5XX errors, RDS failover).
   - When alarms trigger, they **publish messages to an SNS topic**.

6. **Notifications**
   - SNS pushes notifications to subscribers:
     - **Email** (system administrators)  
     - **Slack** (team channels for instant visibility)

## ✅ Benefits of This Architecture

* **Elasticity** → Automatically adapts to traffic demand with Auto Scaling.
* **Resilience** → Multi-AZ ensures high availability and failover support.
* **Observability** → CloudWatch monitors system health and performance.
* **Proactive Alerting** → SNS delivers notifications to Slack and Email in real time.
* **Security** → Isolated VPC design with public/private subnet separation.

## 🔮 Possible Enhancements

* Add **AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall)** to protect against web exploits.
* Use **CloudTrail** for auditing API calls.
* Add **Elasticache (Redis/Memcached)** for performance optimization.
* Enable **CloudWatch Logs Insights** for deeper log analytics.
* Integrate with **EventBridge** for event-driven automation.
